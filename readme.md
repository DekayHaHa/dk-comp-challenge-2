# Static Comp 2!
- A static comp project from the Front End program at Turing

## Motivation
- This static comp came easier than the last but pushed me to learn about new aspects of css. It was very rewarding as I learned new techniques and different approaches to similar features from past projects. This helped keep me focused on the ultimate goal of learning. 


## Build status
- 95%
- Add Media Query for 540px to 320px.
- Color checkboxes accordingly.
- Clean up HTML/CSS of redundancies.


## Tech/framework used
- HTML, CSS, in Sublime.
- Grid, Flex, SVG, Media Query, and Positioning (Relative/Absolute).
